## **A. Exposure Summary**

Our firm expects to receive a **€8,000,000 EUR receivable in one year** from international pharmaceutical exports. Because the company reports financial results in **USD**, the ultimate dollar value of this receivable depends on the **EUR/USD exchange rate at maturity**.

This creates **foreign exchange (FX) risk**: if the euro depreciates against the U.S. dollar before the receivable is collected, the USD cash inflow will be lower than expected, potentially impacting earnings, budgeting accuracy, and cash flow planning. While euro appreciation would increase USD proceeds, the firm bears downside risk that may outweigh speculative upside given the operational nature of this cash flow.

## **B. Summary of Hedge Outcomes**

Three primary hedging approaches were evaluated using the Stage 3 Excel model:

### **Forward Hedge**

* Locks in a fixed USD amount today using the one-year forward rate.  
* Provides **complete certainty** over USD proceeds.  
* Eliminates both downside risk and upside potential.

### **Money Market Hedge**

* Replicates a forward hedge through borrowing euros, converting at spot, and investing USD.  
* Produces **USD proceeds nearly identical to the forward hedge**, confirming interest rate parity.  
* Requires more balance-sheet activity and operational complexity.

### **Option Hedges (Put and Call)**

* **EUR Put Option**: Establishes a floor on USD proceeds while allowing upside if the euro strengthens.  
* **EUR Call Option**: Provides upside protection but is less relevant for hedging a receivable.  
* Option outcomes vary with the ending spot rate (S\_T) and require payment of an upfront premium.

Overall, forwards and money market hedges deliver certainty, while options introduce flexibility at a cost.

## **C. Sensitivity Interpretation**

Sensitivity analysis evaluated hedge performance across a range of ending spot rates from **0.95×S₀ to 1.05×S₀**.

### **EUR Depreciation**

* Forward and money market hedges provide **stable USD proceeds** regardless of EUR weakness.  
* The put option protects against losses below the strike but results in lower net proceeds due to the premium.  
* Unhedged exposure experiences the greatest downside risk.

### **EUR Appreciation**

* Forward and money market hedges do not benefit from favorable FX movements.  
* The put option allows participation in upside appreciation, making it attractive when upside is valued.  
* The call option benefits appreciation but is less aligned with receivable protection.

### **Key Trade-offs**

* **Certainty vs. Flexibility**: Forwards/MM provide certainty; options provide flexibility.  
* **Cost**: Options require an upfront premium; forwards/MM do not.  
* **Complexity**: Money market hedges are operationally more complex than forwards.

## **D. Strategic Recommendation**

**Recommended Strategy: Forward Hedge**

For this exposure, a **forward contract** is the most appropriate hedging strategy.

Rationale:

* The receivable represents **operating cash flow**, not a speculative position.  
* Budget certainty and earnings predictability are more valuable than upside optionality.  
* The forward hedge delivers the **highest confidence in USD proceeds** with minimal complexity.  
* The money market hedge provides no meaningful advantage over the forward once operational costs are considered.

While a EUR put option could be considered if management explicitly values upside participation, the **premium cost reduces expected net proceeds** and may not align with the firm’s conservative risk profile.

## **E. Executive Justification**

From a senior management perspective, the forward hedge best supports:

* **Cash Flow Stability**: Guaranteed USD proceeds simplify treasury planning.  
* **Budget Certainty**: Eliminates FX-driven earnings volatility.  
* **Liquidity Management**: No upfront premium or borrowing requirements.  
* **Operational Simplicity**: Easy to implement and monitor.  
* **Risk Discipline**: Aligns with a non-speculative approach to FX exposure.

Overall, the forward hedge provides the cleanest and most cost-effective solution for managing this EUR receivable, consistent with prudent financial risk management practices.
